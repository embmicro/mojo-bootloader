This is the Arduino compatible bootloader that ships preloaded on the AVR on the Mojo V3.

It is a slightly modified version of the bootloader for the Arduino Leonardo.

To build the bootloader for the ATmega32U4 (Mojo V3 and some V2) use Makefile-v3 (the default). To build the bootloader for the ATmega16U4 (Mojo V2) copy Makefile-v2 to Makefile and run make.
